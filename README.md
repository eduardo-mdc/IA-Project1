## About

AI project repository focused on developing search algorithms and heuristics to solve and play the popular game where you roll a block which moves by falling horizontally and vertically. The implemented search algorithms and heuristics are designed to analyze the game board, evaluate possible moves, and select the optimal path to victory. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, enabling it to handle a wide range of game configurations and challenges

## Setup Guide
